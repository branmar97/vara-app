# Product Requirements Document: Navigation Sidebar

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The navigation sidebar is a persistent UI element designed to help signed-in users efficiently navigate between key pages of the application. It provides quick access to notifications, settings, and core app sections, improving the overall user experience by making navigation intuitive and visually clear.

## 2. Goals

- Enable users to easily switch between main application pages.
- Provide quick access to notifications and settings.
- Ensure the sidebar is visually modern, responsive, and consistent with the app’s design system (TailwindCSS and shadcn UI).

## 3. User Stories

- As a user, I want to quickly access my notifications and settings from the sidebar.
- As a user, I want to navigate between pages using the sidebar.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The sidebar must only be visible to signed-in users.
2. The sidebar must be positioned on the left side of the screen, with all page content displayed to its right.
3. The top section must include:
   - A logo placeholder at the top.
   - A divider below the logo.
   - The signed-in user’s first name, with a notification bell and settings cog to the right (placeholders for now).
4. Below the user section, the sidebar must display navigation links to the following pages, each with an icon to the left:
   - Dashboard
   - Recurring
   - Spending
   - Budgets
   - Goals
   - Net Worth
   - Transactions
5. The currently active page link must be visually highlighted (e.g., with an active color or style).
6. The bottom section must include a Help & Support link with an icon to the left like the other nav links.
7. The sidebar must be responsive:
   - On small screens, only icons are shown for page links (link names are hidden).
   - The user’s name is hidden on small screens, but the notification bell and settings cog remain visible but stacked.
8. Clicking a navigation link must update the main page view to show placeholder content for that page.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- No integration with real user data, notifications, or settings (placeholders only).
- No logout or profile editing functionality in the sidebar.
- No support for unauthenticated users.

## 6. Design Considerations

- Use a modern look and feel, leveraging TailwindCSS and shadcn UI components.
- Color scheme and icon choices are at the developer’s discretion, but should be visually appealing and accessible.
- Ensure clear visual distinction for the active page link.
- Divider and spacing should provide a clean, uncluttered appearance.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Built with React Router v7 for navigation.
- Use TailwindCSS and shadcn UI for styling and components.
- Initial implementation uses placeholders for user name, notifications, and settings.
- Structure should be easy to extend for future integration with real data.

## 8. Success Metrics

- The user can see their first name, notification bell, and settings cog in the sidebar (placeholders).
- The user can click on navigation links and the main page content updates accordingly.
- The sidebar is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes as specified.
- The active page link is clearly highlighted.

## 9. Open Questions

- Are there any specific icons or icon libraries preferred for the navigation links?
- Should the Help & Support link open a modal, navigate to a page, or is it just a placeholder for now?
